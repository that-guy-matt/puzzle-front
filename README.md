# Puzzle Front

A front page for a puzzle game that is a future project.

## About the project

This web page is a somewhat generic front page for a puzzle game, or really any sort of small game which should be played in the browser. It currently is not entirely functional as it is not connected to the back end, but the templates exist for portfolio pages, log in form, and so on.

The game itself is a future project and the styling of the website will be updated to fit with the style of the game.

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- Bootstrap

## Roadmap

Future plans for the project:

1. Connect the front end to the back end
2. Create a fitting puzzle game
3. Reskin the website to fit the style of the game, if necessary
